# Title (replace with your title)

Welcome to this tutorial where we dive deep into how to validate email addresses using regular expressions (Regex). By the end, you'll understand each component of the email-matching regex and how it works.

## Summary

The regex we'll focus on is for email validation: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. This tutorial will break down each part of this regex to explain its functionality.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Characters: ^ and $

What They Do: Specify the start (^) and end ($) of the string to be matched.

### Quantifiers

Characters: *, +, {n}, {n,}, {n,m}

What They Do: Specify how many times a character or a group of characters can appear.

### OR Operator

Character: |

What It Does: Allows for alternative matches between different patterns.

### Character Classes

Characters: [...], [^...]

What They Do: Define sets of characters that can match. A caret (^) negates the set, meaning it will match characters not in the set.

### Flags

Characters: i, g, m, etc.

What They Do: Modify the behavior of the entire regex. For example, i makes it case-insensitive.

### Grouping and Capturing

Characters: ( ... )

What They Do: Group elements of the regex together, and capture the text that matches the group.

### Bracket Expressions

Characters: [...]

What They Do: Similar to character classes, but with a narrower use case. Typically used for defining sets of single characters.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Characters: *, *?, +?, {n,m}?

What They Do: Specify how much content to consume. Greedy consumes as much as possible, lazy as little as possible.

### Boundaries

Characters: \b, \B

What They Do: \b matches a word boundary, while \B matches a non-word boundary.

### Back-references

Characters: \1, \2, etc.

What They Do: Refer back to previously captured groups in the regex, allowing for repeated patterns.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Characters: (?=...), (?!...), (?<=...), (?<!...)

What They Do: Check for patterns ahead or behind the current position without including them in the match.
